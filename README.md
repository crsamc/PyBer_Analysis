# PyBer_Challenge
## Overview
Using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
## Results

Based on the ride-sharing data
- Rural areas have the highest average fare per rider and driver. This is folllowed then by Suburban and the least in Urban.
- Urban areas have the highest amount of riders as well as drivers and Rural areas have the least.
- Urban areas have 2.6x the amount of riders than Suburban and 2.06x the total fares
- Suburban areas have 5x the amount of riders than Rural and 4.47x the total fares
- Rural areas averaged ~1.6 rides to every driver: Suburban area averaged ~1.275 riders per every driver: Urban areas averaged ~.675 riders per every driver, there are 780 more drivers than rides 
## Summary
  Based on the data, there are some business recommendations for the CEO for addressing disparities among the cities.
  - Limit the sign-up for ride-sharing drivers. There is a deficit of rides to drivers in Urban areas. This causes the drivers to be competitive and atleast 780 drivers went without riders, making no money.
  - Rural areas are probably larger with longer rides, taking up more of the drivers time per ride. These areas could use some more drivers to help balance.
